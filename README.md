# Setup-Scripts
Setup scripts that you can run to download developer tools

Currently only for Mac

## What it does
The first script downloads iTerm2 - a powerful development tool that most people prefer over the standard terminal for Mac.
The second script downloads more dev tools from iTerm2, including python3, and guides the user through creating some aliases that I've found helpful

## How to use
Once you set up your new laptop, copy and paste the setup.sh and setup2.sh files in your root directory, `~/`. From there, just type `. setup.sh`, and follow the instructions.
