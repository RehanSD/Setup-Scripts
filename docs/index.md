# Setup Scripts
Developers spend a lot of time installing things to install other cool things - why not automate the process? Set up your new laptop, server, desktop, etc., with the tools you need to succeed.

Setup Scripts are a repository with scripts that allow you to minimize the amount of time you spend in rote installation of dev tools like Homebrew, python3, and java - allowing you to focus on making kickass products.

## Usage
To use, just run `sh setup.sh` from your Terminal Command Line. The script will take care of downloading and installing iTerm, and prompt you to run the second script, `setup2.sh`, which installs the following:
* Homebrew
* Python3
* Java
* Git
* Git completion for bash

It also guides you through aliasing the following tools:
* Python3
* Git commands
  * checkout
  * status

And create the following git-related functions:
* Pushing new branches upstream
* Committing all args passed
* Creating new branches
* Cloning
